# Me tauri app

What is this app trying to accomplish???

- Absolutely nothing;
- Absolutely nothing again;
- And, of course, dissapointment;

# 01.04.2023
The First actual update!

- Added support for multiple peeps to be added at once before being flushed
- The application actually builds (wow)
- Added TypeScript code so unsafe not even a sandbox can save your PC!

# 06.04.2023
The Second update!

- Added metadata support, will try to make it easily extendable
- Unique IDs for peeps via Metadata (look in main.ts), later will be used for sqlite3 integration!
- Plans for the next update: add sqlite3 integration, make `main.ts` be able to pull from the database via a backend call, make a table layout for returned peeps.
